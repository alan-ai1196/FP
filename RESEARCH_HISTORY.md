# FP Research History — R5 to Current

This is a **logic history**, not a version changelog. It records why the theory changed and which failures produced the current foundation. Historical files/commits are provenance; `FP_THEORY.md` alone is normative.

## 1. R5: provenance became structural information

R5's sparse Factor–Provenance formulation made a basic distinction that survives every later rewrite. A positive SUM contains alternative derivations; backward task credit is signed, but responsibility routes it through the positive derivation decomposition. The important lesson was not the particular sparse implementation. It was that **marginalizing derivation/provenance identity before proving it irrelevant can erase the discriminative subspace needed for structural learning**.

This became the first instance of the later “premature quotient” diagnosis.

## 2. R17: discovery moved from edit enumeration to operator geometry

Early Compiler thinking implicitly scored candidate edges/actions one at a time. R17 showed that JVP/VJP/mixed-HVP/range-sketch operators could expose whole interaction subspaces without all-pairs enumeration. A structured `n=512` hidden-permutation audit used 8 mixed-HVP probes where naive pair inspection exposes 262,144 interactions.

The durable conclusion was **use the strongest legal response operator geometry before coordinate enumeration**. The later theory corrected one overreach: an operator sketch is an acquisition/proposal mechanism, not automatically a positive semantic factorization or a global certificate.

## 3. Trial 1C: raw width was not the missing answer

Scaling Trial 1C calibrated the native block under a fixed coarse structure. Important recorded numbers were:

- `K/d` ratios `{0.25, 1, 1.75, 2.5, 3.25}`;
- at M scale, `CE_2.5 - CE_1 = +0.0179788`, CI `[0.0034627, 0.0324949]`;
- selected FP mean CE `4.2794413` versus dense `4.1196805`, gap `0.1597609`;
- removing relation-position information produced a `+0.2846545` CE diagnostic.

The inference was deliberately narrow: **more raw coordinates inside the same coarse cells had saturated; the problem was structural information/representation, not another K sweep.** Trial 1C became a falsification/calibration experiment, not a source of a new hand-written topology.

## 4. R19–R30: a candidate is a lifecycle, not a static graph

The Compiler then learned that a locally cheaper or better structure can be globally bad once build/switch/run/state/proof costs and reuse horizon are included. Candidate program state was separated from active execution state. Dependency generations and provenance-aware certificate validity were introduced to stop stale reusable results from silently becoming current proof.

This stage was the beginning of treating the Compiler itself as a causal physical system rather than an offline graph chooser.

## 5. R31–R37: local edits failed; frontier representation mattered

R31–R35 established that:

1. first-order structural scores are proposals, not finite decisions;
2. exact one-edit improvements need not compose;
3. coordinated changes can cross a loss barrier even when constituents are individually unprofitable;
4. high-order interaction should exploit provenance structure rather than instantiate generic dense high-order tensors.

R36–R37 shifted attention from raw depth to **typed frontier complexity**. A bad representation can have exponentially large cut rank while an intermediate typed distinction changes the cut and collapses the frontier. This weakened the idea that low rank inside a fixed representation was the universal escape.

## 6. R40–R44: support semantics replaced duplicated branches

R40 re-established a native recurrent SUM/PRODUCT runtime. Naively duplicated SUM branches remained symmetric and collapsed. R41's decisive correction was that a useful alternative is a **distinct provenance-support cell**, not merely another activation channel. Function-preserving support refinement/deduplication/shared factors became preferable to activation-repulsion regularizers.

The later foundation deliberately removed `SPLIT/MERGE/REWIRE/BIRTH` as canonical action names. A support refinement is a semantic/program relation or a Compiler search partition, not a new model primitive.

## 7. v13–v23: response geometry, reachable value and certified physical search

The theory progressively enlarged the object being valued:

- dormant structural response;
- quotient against incumbent-reachable value capacity;
- finite optimizer trajectory rather than frozen coefficients;
- full positive output-fiber measure rather than a preselected categorical output;
- physical cost and sharing/reuse;
- branch lower/upper bounds and exact-NLL fallback;
- finite branch-and-bound with an explicit unresolved gap.

v22 killed the “project/optimize response first, realize physically later” interpretation: identical response can reverse preference under physical cost, and hard budgets can make the unpriced cone optimum irrelevant. v23 therefore unified response and physical realization inside one finite physical-program search.

v23 then made a **closure claim too early**.

## 8. R4.2 real-GPU counterexample: formal coverage was not constructive coverage

The R4.2/V23 implementation is preserved in `experiments/legacy_r4_2_v23/` because it generated one of the most important negative results.

On the seed-1337 real trace, native validation CE at 450/900/1800/3600 seconds was approximately

`7.5940907001, 7.5940836133, 7.5940836133, 7.5940843225`,

while the audited empty-program/unigram reference was `7.5940850973`. Evidence throughput reached ~99.7% of the strong-GPT token throughput by 3600s, so simple starvation was not the explanation. Telemetry showed `product_nodes = 0`: the concrete Compiler repeatedly fit/deleted a tiny atomic family instead of economically searching the declared compound grammar.

This falsified **the previous closure claim**, not positive SUM/PRODUCT semantics. v24 withdrew the claim that interaction order/constructive bridge had been solved and imposed new gates: compound descendants without profitable parents, joint realization, one causal clock, robust numerical/statistical persistence, and a hierarchical anti-unigram witness.

## 9. v25→v155: complete physical learner became complete self-Compiler state

v25 repaired the immediate R4.2 failure by making fixed charges/sharing/ancestor closure, same-token value continuation and fresh persistence part of one branch lifecycle. Subsequent adversarial compaction to v155 kept finding places where a projection had silently discarded information:

- current task output vs future learner update;
- current response vs later continuation;
- semantic program equality vs physical cost/encoding;
- ordinary learner equivalence vs future Compiler optionality;
- ledger summary vs actually resident shadows/jobs;
- coarse optimizer-unit equality vs event-level reference↔AMP behavior;
- current cursor vs replay/transport state;
- candidate-specific evidence vs global selective testing/error allocation.

v155's final runtime object was therefore the complete self-Compiler configuration `Omega=(xi,iota,s,m_C,kappa)` with global filtration and atomic boundary transition.

## 10. v156: rank/state and “exact scalable Compiler” claims were attacked

v156 deliberately attacked the compact theory rather than defending it.

- Fixed-generator shift-closed positive predictive dimension was recognized as a **restricted invariant-cone positive realization** notion.
- Exact one-shot degree capacity was tightened to `binom(k+d,d)`.
- General recurrent FP counterexamples showed one positive scalar can carry behavior whose finite-horizon linear span grows without bound, even to full `2^H` in a constructive family. Thus response/nonnegative rank is not a general recurrent state-coordinate lower bound.
- Exact NMF hardness showed that a universal polynomial-time exact Compiler was the wrong target; finite exhaustive correctness is not a scaling theorem.

## 11. v157–v161: the patch wall was diagnosed as premature quotient + hidden oracle + tractability confusion

The accumulated corrections were compressed into a root-cause triad:

```text
complete claim state
+ legal information/query interface
+ actual physical computation/resource model
```

A claim-relative behavioral congruence theorem explained why current-function/short-horizon/semantic-only projections repeatedly failed. Behavioral packing/covering replaced rank as the representation-independent capacity starting point.

Typed-frontier dynamic programming made exact solve cost explicit: known local factors can be solved in work exponential in the typed frontier load `Phi`, and an unrestricted frontier table under point queries needs `e^Phi` exact queries in the worst case.

Acquisition was separated from solve. A hidden permutation can be recovered from one information-rich vector probe; an exact rank-r response matrix can be reconstructed with `r` forward plus `r` adjoint vector probes under the declared two-sided interface. This removed the misleading idea that “number of probes” alone measures information complexity.

## 12. v162–v164: PRODUCT acquisition and physical materialization were separated

The old Round-35 result `q*=d` for a depth-d pure PRODUCT path was reclassified correctly: it is a **local-jet observation-language lower bound**, not a universal self-compilation lower bound. If finite-amplitude subset probes are legal, a hidden conjunction reduces to group testing. For general positive SUM/PRODUCT completion, the boundary mass becomes a nonnegative polynomial and Boolean support probes reduce to hidden-hypergraph/monotone-DNF acquisition. But the result is explicitly interface-relative; prefix-only or passive interfaces can remain non-identifying.

Then a separate wall appeared even after acquisition is free: indivisible physical fixed charges turn support materialization into a discrete problem containing 0–1 knapsack. Continuous positive-measure KKT flow describes divisible semantic allocation but cannot replace the physical Compiler.

## 13. Foundation R4: one principle replaces the patch wall

The final foundation compressed these histories into one rule:

> **Never erase or assume information before proving every legal future continuation relevant to the claim cannot use it.**

Candidate generation no longer starts from an externally supplied architecture menu. A resource-bounded native program is built recursively from source references, SUM, PRODUCT and delayed binding. Exact state reduction is allowed only through claim-relative contextual congruence. Information acquisition is legal-interface-relative. Physical materialization is history/resource/ownership-aware. Search can be hard; `UNRESOLVED` is a first-class correct result.

Foundation R4 was frozen for Reference Compiler implementation on 2026-09-04. The theory was then consolidated into root `FP_THEORY.md` during the GitHub migration on 2026-09-06.

## 14. Current frontier: implementation is the pressure test

The first Reference Compiler implementation pass was intentionally adversarial. It found API-level ways a supposedly correct implementation could still fake the theorem object: caller-supplied uppers, safety/bridge/equivalence booleans, arbitrary candidate state/object lists, prediction-visible gradient accumulators, unregistered query payloads, ownership-free ledgers, hidden NaN tolerance, data reuse and incomplete Runtime snapshots.

An intermediate strict module set passed 24/24 unit tests and 47/47 executable gates, then the complete Runtime was hardened further. The final endpoint integration was **not re-frozen** before migration. That exact implementation boundary is documented in `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and is the next research task.
